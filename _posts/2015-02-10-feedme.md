I created what I think is a really nice RSS parser library for Ruby, called <a href="https://github.com/jdidion/feedme">FeedMe</a>. It is based on regular expressions, which means it is very flexible, although not as fast as other RSS libraries. 

Note that this code is ~5 years old and was only tested on Ruby 1.x. Please file issues if you find any.
